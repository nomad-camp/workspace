### Images

10 x One-phrase-Hooks selling the dream — 1 for each target group

- Example 2: *“The Manual for Turning your office-job to a location-independant work”*  
- Example 3: *“A place where other people build your business… while you camp in the sun with them.”*  

---

### Videos

1–3 minutes naming the target group, their pain points, and solution.  
Make 10 x the same video and change the first 5 seconds.

#### Examples for the first 5 seconds:

- Example 1: *“What stops most people from switching to remote-work is not their current job or their background, but simply not knowing how to.”*  
- Example 2: *“When it comes to changing your work to remote-work, most people don’t know that you can make this change without having to risk your current job.”*  
- Example 3: *“It’s a shame that most brilliant ideas out there never see the light of day — only because they lack the experts to execute them. Our mission is to change that — while camping with you in a Tipi”*  
- Example 4: *“Want to work remotely but scared to risk your current job? Most people who are in that situation simply drop the idea. But you can actually build your remote-work setup slowly without any risks.”*  

→ Test 20 hooks over 1 week for €1–3 per day each  
→ After 1 week the best performing 1–3 ads stay and all ad budget is allocated to the winning ads only
