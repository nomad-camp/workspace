This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the **Nomad Camp** project - a concept for creating a global network of temporary communities where digital nomads connect authentically, share skills, and build lasting friendships in beautiful natural settings.

## Project Structure

This repository contains the complete concept documentation for Nomad Camp. The primary document is `readme.md` which contains the full vision, philosophy, and implementation strategy for the nomad community concept.

## Key Concepts

### Core Philosophy
- **Friendship-First Approach**: Primary goal is creating genuine, lifelong friendships among nomads
- **Natural Settings**: Beautiful locations over convenient cities
- **Flexible Attendance**: Completely flexible come-and-go model with 2-month camp durations
- **Organic Programming**: Natural activities over forced events

### Target Groups
1. **Experienced Nomads** - seeking authentic community and meaningful connections
2. **Nomad Curious** - considering nomadic lifestyle transition
3. **Struggling Nomads** - need support for sustainable setup
4. **Sponsors** - want visibility and collaboration with professional nomads

### Revenue Model
- **Daily Fee**: €20/day (sliding scale)
- **Nomad Marketplace**: 15% commission on services
- **Sponsorship Packages**: €500-€2,000 tiers
- **Future Camp Bookings**: Alumni priority system

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Pilot Camp (August-September)
- Location: Italy, Austria, Germany, or France
- Participants: 8-15 nomads
- Focus: Test core concept, document what works

### Phase 2: Refinement
- Analysis and feedback gathering
- Documentation of replicable framework
- Marketing strategy development

### Phase 3: Expansion
- Multiple locations based on demand
- Specialization for different nomad needs
- Partnership development

## Development Notes

This is currently a concept/documentation project with no codebase to build, test, or deploy. The repository serves as the master document for the Nomad Camp vision and strategy.

## Key Differentiators

- **Friendship Focus**: Relationships over networking
- **Natural Settings**: Beautiful locations over convenient cities
- **Flexible Attendance**: Freedom over rigid schedules
- **Authentic Community**: Real connections over professional facades
- **Sustainable Model**: Self-supporting through community value
