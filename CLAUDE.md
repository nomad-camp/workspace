## Key Concepts

### Core Philosophy

- **Natural Settings**: Beautiful locations over convenient cities with fireplace as central hub
- **Flexible Attendance**: Completely flexible come-and-go model within camp periods
- **Organic Programming**: Natural activities and connections over forced events
- **Cost Sharing**: Transparent shared cost model, break-even focus

### Target Groups

2. **Nomad Curious** - considering nomadic lifestyle transition
3. **Struggling Nomads** - need support for sustainable setup
4. **Expert Topics** - yoga, coaching, consulting, IT, marketing workshops
5. **Sponsors** - want visibility and collaboration with professional nomads

### Camp Structure
- **Duration**: 1-2 month camp periods with flexible attendance
- **Accommodation**: Personal tents with optional pre-furnished tent service
- **Central Hub**: Fireplace as main community gathering area
- **Daily Rhythm**: Morning coffee circles, coworking, evening fireplace gatherings
- **Cost Model**: Shared infrastructure costs, external booking platform

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: MVP Website & Marketing

- Authentic brand development
- Landing pages and advertising

### Phase 2: First Camp Launch (September)

## Technical Approach

### Website Strategy
