## 💬 Primary Text

**I was one decision away from burnout.**

✅ I had the “stable job.”  
✅ The bills got paid.  
😞 But my soul? It was rusting.

I wasn’t made for meeting rooms and Zoom fatigue.  
But I didn’t know how to get out — until I did something wild.

🔌 I unplugged.  
Went into nature.  
And met a group of strangers by a campfire…  
who just so happened to be entrepreneurs.

🏕️ We hiked. Swam. Played. Talked.  
And in between laughs, drinks, and hikes — came ideas, insights, and new perspectives of what was possible.

That one trip gave me more clarity than years of online courses.  
Because I didn’t just learn… I *felt supported.*

➡️ **The consequences?**  
3 years later — I run and grow my business from anywhere.  
And I’m never building alone again.

🔥 That experience sparked something big.  
It became the inspiration for **Nomad Camp** —  
A space where others can come unplug, connect, co-create the experience, and grow.

🫶 We’re building the camp I wish I had.  
And now we’re inviting **you** to join us.
