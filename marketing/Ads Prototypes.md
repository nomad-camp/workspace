### 📣 Primary Text

**🔥 I stopped buying online courses... and started building my business by a campfire.**  

📍 I don’t sit in some stuffy office hoping for a breakthrough anymore.  
📍 I don’t waste hours alone, rewatching webinars and taking notes I’ll never use.  
📍 I don’t feel like I’m doing this whole thing alone.

🏕️ Instead — I go hiking with experts.  
I share real convos under the stars.  
I trade ideas by a fire, not in a funnel.

💬 Because when you surround yourself with people who *get it*, you grow without forcing it.  
The business clicks. The loneliness fades. The next step becomes obvious.

Now the beach is his office.**
