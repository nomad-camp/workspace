### 📣 Primary Text

**🔥 I stopped buying online courses... and started building my business by a campfire.**  

📍 I don’t sit in some stuffy office hoping for a breakthrough anymore.  
📍 I don’t waste hours alone, rewatching webinars and taking notes I’ll never use.  
📍 I don’t feel like I’m doing this whole thing alone.

🏕️ Instead — I go hiking with experts.  
I share real convos under the stars.  
I trade ideas by a fire, not in a funnel.

💬 Because when you surround yourself with people who *get it*, you grow without forcing it.  
The business clicks. The loneliness fades. The next step becomes obvious.

**💭 Ever feel like you’re building alone… with no idea what’s missing?**

🌍 You became a digital nomad for freedom — but most days feel like you're just floating.  
📉 Your business isn’t growing… and you’re not sure why.  
💬 And every time you try to solve it, it’s just *more content*, *more courses*, *more screen time*.

🔥 That’s what I was stuck in — until I left the screen behind  
and found answers by a campfire.

Instead of DMs and doubt, I found:  
Fresh ideas. New friends. Unexpected breakthroughs — all while hiking, swimming, and just talking with real entrepreneurs.

**I met entrepreneurs by a campfire —  
and walked away with a roadmap, confidence, and new friends.**

## 🛤️ STORY VERSION

### 🔥 Headline  
**From burnout to beach calls**

### 🔥 Creative (Text-only image suggestion)  
**Build your business by a campfire with experts.**  
One trip changed everything. Now I work wherever I want — and I’m never doing it alone again.

### 💬 Primary Text

**😩 I was one decision away from burnout.**  

I had the “stable job.”  
The bills got paid.  
But my soul? It was slipping.

I wasn’t made for spreadsheets and Zoom fatigue.  
But I didn’t know how to *get out* — until I did something wild.

I unplugged.  
Went into nature.  
And met a group of strangers by a campfire… who just so happened to be entrepreneurs.

🔥 We hiked. Swam. Climbed.  
And in between the laughs and drinks — came ideas, insights, and a new belief in what was possible.

That one trip gave me more clarity than years of online courses.  
Because I didn’t just learn… I *felt supported.*

**Now?  
3 years later — I run my business from anywhere.  
And I’m never building alone again.**
